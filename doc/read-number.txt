READ-NUMBER

Reading numbers from an input stream without using the Lisp reader.

The ‘read-integer’ and ‘read-float’ functions are designed to read
external number representations.  The ‘read-number’ function (to be
defined) is reserved for reading any Lisp number representation.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*default-plus-sign*
   Controls the set of valid plus sign characters when reading an
   external number representation and no explicit plus sign keyword
   argument is specified.  Value has to be a sequence of characters.
   The default is ‘+’ (Unicode U+002B, plus sign).

                                                              [Special Variable]
*default-minus-sign*
   Controls the set of valid minus sign characters when reading an
   external number representation and no explicit minus sign keyword
   argument is specified.  Value has to be a sequence of characters.
   The default is ‘-’ (Unicode U+002D, hyphen-minus).

   Another candidate for this character set is ‘−’ (Unicode U+2212,
   minus sign).

                                                              [Special Variable]
*default-group-separator*
   Controls the set of valid group separator characters when reading
   an external number representation and no explicit group separator
   keyword argument is specified.  Value has to be a sequence of
   characters.  The default is the empty set.

   Candidates for this character set are ‘'’ (Unicode U+0027, apostrophe),
   ‘_’ (Unicode U+005F, low line), ‘ ’ (Unicode U+00A0, no-break space),
   and ‘ ’ (Unicode U+202F, narrow no-break space).  The preferred group
   separator according to ISO 31 is the narrow no-break space character.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*default-decimal-point*
   Controls the set of valid decimal point (or better radix point)
   characters when reading an external number representation and no
   explicit decimal point keyword argument is specified.  Value has to
   be a sequence of characters.  The default is ‘.’ (Unicode U+002E,
   full stop).

   Another candidate for this character set is ‘,’ (Unicode U+002C,
   comma).  ISO 31 uses the decimal point in the international English
   version of the standard and the decimal comma in the original French
   version.  Interactive applications should accept both variants to
   improve usability.

                                                              [Special Variable]
*default-exponent-marker*
   Controls the set of valid exponent marker characters when reading
   an external number representation and no explicit exponent marker
   keyword argument is specified.  Value has to be a sequence of
   characters.  The default is ‘E’, ‘e’, ‘D’, and ‘d’.

   Another candidate for this character set is ‘⏨’ (Unicode U+23E8,
   decimal exponent symbol).

                                                                      [Function]
read-integer (&optional (input-stream *standard-input*) (eof-error-p t)
              eof-value recursivep &key unsigned-number
              (plus-sign *default-plus-sign*) (minus-sign *default-minus-sign*)
              (group-separator *default-group-separator*) (radix 10))
   Read an integer from an input stream.

   Optional first argument INPUT-STREAM is an input stream designator.
    The default is standard input.
   Optional second argument EOF-ERROR-P is a generalized boolean.
    If an end of file error occurs and EOF-ERROR-P is false, EOF-VALUE
    is returned.  Otherwise, signal an ‘end-of-file’ error.  The default
    is true.
   Optional third argument EOF-VALUE is an object.  See above for more
    details.  The default is nil.
   Optional fourth argument RECURSIVEP is a generalized boolean.  True
    means that this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level
    call to ‘read’ or a similar function used by the Lisp reader.  The
    default is false.
   Keyword argument UNSIGNED-NUMBER is a generalized boolean.  True means
    to read an unsigned positive number.  If UNSIGNED-NUMBER is ‘:plus’,
    an explicit plus sign character signals a ‘parse-error’ but negative
    numbers are permitted.  The default is false.
   Keyword argument PLUS-SIGN is a sequence of valid plus sign
    characters.  The plus sign is used to denote a positive number.
    The default is the value of the ‘*default-plus-sign*’ special
    variable.
   Keyword argument MINUS-SIGN is a sequence of valid minus sign
    characters.  The minus sign is used to denote a negative number.
    The default is the value of the ‘*default-minus-sign*’ special
    variable.
   Keyword argument GROUP-SEPARATOR is a sequence of valid group
    separator characters.  The group separator is used to separate the
    digits of a number into groups.  The default is the value of the
    ‘*default-group-separator*’ special variable.  The group separator
    of a number can not change, i.e. the first matching group separator
    fixes the group separator for the rest of the number.
   Keyword argument RADIX is a radix.  Value has to be an integer between
    2 and 36, inclusive.  The default is 10.  Case is not significant for
    the digit characters ‘A’ to ‘Z’ when parsing numbers with a radix
    greater than 10.

   Return value is an integer.  Secondary value is the number of
   characters read.

   The ‘read-integer’ function expects an optional sign followed by a
   non-empty sequence of digits in the specified radix.  It does not
   recognize a decimal point or exponent marker.  Leading or trailing
   whitespace is not ignored.

   If the file ends in the middle of an integer representation,
   ‘read-integer’ signals an ‘end-of-file’ error regardless of
   the value of the EOF-ERROR-P argument.

   The result if undefined if the sequences of valid plus and minus
   sign characters intersect.

                                                                      [Function]
read-float (&optional (input-stream *standard-input*) (eof-error-p t) eof-value
            recursivep &key unsigned-number (plus-sign *default-plus-sign*)
            (minus-sign *default-minus-sign*)
            (group-separator *default-group-separator*)
            (decimal-point *default-decimal-point*)
            (exponent-marker *default-exponent-marker*)
            (float-format *read-default-float-format*) (significand-radix 10)
            (exponent-radix 10) (exponent-base 10))
   Read a floating-point number from an input stream.

   Optional first argument INPUT-STREAM is an input stream designator.
    The default is standard input.
   Optional second argument EOF-ERROR-P is a generalized boolean.
    If an end of file error occurs and EOF-ERROR-P is false, EOF-VALUE
    is returned.  Otherwise, signal an ‘end-of-file’ error.  The default
    is true.
   Optional third argument EOF-VALUE is an object.  See above for more
    details.  The default is nil.
   Optional fourth argument RECURSIVEP is a generalized boolean.  True
    means that this call is expected to be embedded in a higher-level
    call to ‘read’ or a similar function used by the Lisp reader.  The
    default is false.
   Keyword argument UNSIGNED-NUMBER is a generalized boolean.  True means
    to read an unsigned positive number.  If UNSIGNED-NUMBER is ‘:plus’,
    an explicit plus sign character signals a ‘parse-error’ but negative
    numbers are permitted.  The default is false.
   Keyword argument PLUS-SIGN is a sequence of valid plus sign
    characters.  The plus sign is used to denote a positive number.
    The default is the value of the ‘*default-plus-sign*’ special
    variable.
   Keyword argument MINUS-SIGN is a sequence of valid minus sign
    characters.  The minus sign is used to denote a negative number.
    The default is the value of the ‘*default-minus-sign*’ special
    variable.
   Keyword argument GROUP-SEPARATOR is a sequence of valid group
    separator characters.  The group separator is used to separate the
    digits of a number into groups.  The default is the value of the
    ‘*default-group-separator*’ special variable.  The group separator
    of a number can not change, i.e. the first matching group separator
    fixes the group separator for the rest of the number.
   Keyword argument DECIMAL-POINT is a sequence of valid decimal point
    characters.  The decimal point is used to separate the integer part
    of the significand from its fractional part.  The default is the
    value of the ‘*default-decimal-point*’ special variable.
   Keyword argument EXPONENT-MARKER is a sequence of valid exponent
    marker characters.  The exponent marker is used to separate the
    significand from the exponent.  It does not specify the data type
    of the return value.  The default is the value of the
    ‘*default-exponent-marker*’ special variable.
   Keyword argument FLOAT-FORMAT specifies the data type of the
    return value.  Value is either ‘short-float’, ‘single-float’,
    ‘double-float’, or ‘long-float’.  The default is the value of the
    ‘*read-default-float-format*’ special variable.  A value of ‘nil’
    means that the return value is a rational number.
   Keyword argument SIGNIFICAND-RADIX and EXPONENT-RADIX is the radix
    for the digits of the significand and exponent respectively.  Value
    has to be an integer between 2 and 36, inclusive.  The default is 10.
    Case is not significant for the digit characters ‘A’ to ‘Z’ when
    parsing numbers with a radix greater than 10.
   Keyword argument EXPONENT-BASE is the base of the power term.  Value
    has to be an integer greater than or equal to 2.  The default is 10.

   Return value is a floating-point number of type FLOAT-FORMAT iff a
   decimal point or exponent part is present and FLOAT-FORMAT is not
   null.  Otherwise, value is a rational number.  Secondary value is
   the number of characters read.

   The ‘read-float’ function expects an optional sign followed by a
   non-empty sequence of digits.  It does recognize a decimal point and
   an exponent part.  Leading or trailing whitespace is not ignored.

   If the file ends in the middle of a floating-point number
   representation, ‘read-float’ signals an ‘end-of-file’ error
   regardless of the value of the EOF-ERROR-P argument.

   Converting a floating-point number to the specified FLOAT-FORMAT
   type may signal an ‘arithmetic-error’ condition, for example, a
   ‘floating-point-overflow’ or ‘floating-point-underflow’ error.

   The result if undefined if the sequences of valid plus and minus
   sign characters intersect.
